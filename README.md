# Phaser Bouncing Ball

## Live Server

Once the project is open, start the **Live Server** Server to see your game in action. Here's how:

1. Open the command palette by pressing `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac).
2. Alternatively, you can press the **Command Bar** at the top, which should say `phaser-bouncing-ball`, then press `>` on your keyboard to start typing a command.
3. Type in `Live Server: Open with Live Server`. It may auto-complete. Select it by pressing `Return`.
4. A new tab should pop up with your game.

You're all set to preview your game!

## GitHub Copilot

When you have things set up, it's time to install **GitHub Copilot** and **GitHub Copilot Chat** to get some AI assistance.

1. Click on the Extensions icon in the sidebar (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+X` on macOS).
2. In the search bar at the top, type `GitHub Copilot` and press Enter.
3. Find the extension named **GitHub Copilot** (listed as by GitHub) and click the `Install` button.
4. Next, clear the search bar and type `GitHub Copilot Chat`, and `Install` it.
5. After both installations, you can access Copilot by clicking on the GitHub Copilot icon (which looks like an oval with two eyes and goggles) on the right of the command palette.

You're all set to use `GitHub Copilot` and `GitHub Copilot Chat` in your projects! Do note that GitHub Copilot Chat's free tier only supports 50 messages a month -- use carefully and sparingly!

## How to commit and save

After you've made a simple change:

1. Click on the **Source Control** icon in the sidebar. It looks like 3 connected circles, or press `Ctrl+Shift+G` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+Shift+G` on Mac.
2. You'll see your changed files under `Changes`. Each modified file will have an `M` next to it.
3. Hover near the `Changes` section, and press the `+` button that shows up. This tells GitHub you want to save all these new files.
4. Type a short message describing your changes in the text box at the top of the Source Control panel. Good commit messages are brief but descriptive, like "Add animation for bouncing ball" or "Fix bouncing ball speed".
5. Press the green `âœ“ Commit` button, or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (Mac) to commit your changes. (If you forgot to do step 3, you'll see a pop-up about staging your changes. Choose `Always`.)
6. After it's done, the green button should change to `ðŸ”„ Sync Changes`. Press that.
7. You'll be prompted with `This action will pull and push commits from and to "origin/main"`. Choose `OK, Don't Show Again`.
8. You'll be asked (bottom right) `Would you like Visual Studio Code to periodically run "git fetch"?`. Choose `Yes`.

Your changes are now saved on GitHub! You can verify this by going to your repository on github.com/your-username and checking the repositories.

Note: If you see a number badge on the Source Control icon while working, it indicates how many files have been modified but not yet committed.
